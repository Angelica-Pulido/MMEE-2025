# Project: 1.Frogs/

The folders and files for this project are as follow:

#### Data/Phylo/:
	- MMEE_2023_CO1/
		A directory with the forward and reverse reads from the sequencing center for YOUR samples
	- AllSeq_AllOutgroup_Aligned.fasta
		fasta formatted sequences for many Hyla species that you can use as outgroup

#### Data/RADphylo/:
	You can use this file to check plot a NJ tree of Hyla individuals. But this is optional, you don’t need this file in the actual version of the practical.

#### Data/RADpopgen/:
	- hyla_FSTAT.dat
		Data for population analyses in fstat format
	- populations_numeric_codes.txt
		File with a numeric code for each population. 
  		You have to use this file to change the population column in the R object created when you read the hyla_FSTAT.dat file.

#### Data/RADstructure/:
	- Hyla.struct.geno
		data for Structure-like analyses in geno format, ready for sNMF analyses.
	- PopId.txt
		Population ID (from 1 to 12) of each individual in the geno file. Line_3 = individual_3 = Population_1
