# Project: 1.Frogs/

The folders and files for this project are as follow:

#### Data/Phylo/:
	A directory with the forward and reverse reads from the sequencing marker for YOUR samples.
	- rag1_Sanger_reference.fasta & rhod_Sanger_reference.fasta:
 		in case your file is empty, you can use these files.
	- B2F_rag.ab1 , B2R_rag.ab1 , D2F_rho.ab1 , D2R_rho.ab1 
		forward and reverse reads from the markers used in the weblab, use this files on https://www.gear-genomics.com/teal/ to check their chromatograms.
	- Rag1_Reference_sequences.fasta & Rhod_Reference_sequences.fasta
		fasta formatted sequences for many frog species that you can use to built a phylogeny. Use the outgroup to root the tree.
